/**
 * One accent per top-level account: a hue, and the glyph that wears it.
 *
 * The hue is a CLASS STRING rather than a colour value, and it is stated once
 * per account rather than once per element. Three things about it, each of
 * which has bitten this example:
 *
 * 1. **It is a literal.** Tailwind scans source TEXT, so a computed
 *    `text-${hue}-600` compiles to nothing and the list ships uncoloured.
 * 2. **It is a light/dark PAIR.** A 600 that is comfortable on a white card is
 *    muddy on a near-black popup, so the dark half steps up to a 400.
 * 3. **It pins BOTH levels, with `!`.** The shared combobox sheet paints the
 *    highlighted row with `data-highlighted:**:text-accent-foreground`, a
 *    DESCENDANT selector. An icon set draws with `fill="currentColor"` or
 *    `stroke="currentColor"`, and either way the `<path>` inherits it and
 *    resolves it against ITS OWN colour, which the sheet has just repainted.
 *    Pinning the svg alone measures correct and still paints grey, so the
 *    `**:` half is not belt and braces, it is the half that works.
 *
 * The whole string goes on the TILE, not on the glyph. The `**:` half reaches
 * the glyph and its paths from there, so one class covers both, and the tile's
 * own `color` becomes the account hue - which is what lets the selected state
 * below tint from `currentColor` instead of restating eight palettes.

/**
 * How a selected row says so, now that the built-in check is gone.
 *
 * `indicator={false}` on the root drops the single-select check AND the

 * end where the tile starts on the other edge. What it does not do is decide
 * how selection reads instead - that is this, and the row is what publishes the
 * state: `data-selected` lands on the row in every mode, and `in-data-[selected]`
 * is how a child paints from an ancestor's attribute. The primitive's own
 * checkbox is wired the same way, from the same attribute, one element deeper.
 *
 * The tile is the right thing to change because it is already the row's
 * identity column: the eye starts there, and one filled tile in a column of
 * outlined ones is unmissable in a way a tinted row is not once the pointer is
 * painting rows anyway.
 *
 * Two channels, not one. The FILL and the RING are geometry - a box that was
 * empty is now full, and has gained an edge it did not have - and the label
 * steps from `font-medium` to `font-semibold` under it. Someone who cannot
 * separate sky from teal still sees which row is marked. The colour is the
 * account's own hue rather than `primary`, which is what keeps the mark part
 * of the identity system this example is about.
 *
 * Everything derives from `currentColor`, which the accent above has already
 * pinned with `!` - so the mark survives the row being highlighted, in light
 * and in dark, without eight more literals. The `!` here is for the other
 * reason: `IconTile`'s `outline` variant states `bg-background` and
 * `dark:bg-input/32`, and a `dark:` utility and an `in-*:` one have no
 * guaranteed order between them.

 * The tile is a real component rather than a `div` because it carries the
 * per-style radius. A literal radius would be wrong in lyra and sera (square)
 * and wrong again in maia and luma (much rounder).
 *
 * The glyph carries no `size-*`. `IconTile` sizes its children through
 * `--icon-tile-icon-size` with a `[&_svg:not([class*=size-])]` selector, so any
 * `size-` class on the svg opts that child out of the tile's own scale and the
 * glyph stops tracking the tile when the size token changes. That is exactly
 * why one component can serve both the 32px tile in a row and the 24px one on

/**

 * two lines of type - a name, and a code plus an amount - which stack to about
 * 38px. `xs` at 24px reads as a stray glyph glued to the top line, and the 40px
 * default is TALLER than the text beside it, so the tile stops being the row's
 * identity column and starts being the thing that sets the row's height. At
 * 32px the text is what the row is tall for again, and the row gives back the
 * couple of pixels it was carrying for the tile alone.
 *
 * Nothing here has to align anything by hand. The row is `items-center` and the
 * icon slot is a `shrink-0` flex box inside it, so a 32px tile centres against
 * the whole two-line block rather than hanging off the title - and the count
 * and chevron on the far edge centre against the same block.
 *
 * `IconTile`'s `outline` variant is a plain bordered surface: one border, one
 * background, no tint of its own. That is still the point at rest. The colour
 * is a per-account IDENTIFIER, not a status, and a column of eight filled
 * swatches reads as eight alerts - so the chrome stays neutral, only the GLYPH
 * carries the hue, and the eye has one variable to track instead of two. The
 * one tile that does fill is the selected one, which is the whole reason the
 * rest stay quiet.

/**
 * Colour that means something: an expense account picker.
 *
 * Each top-level account owns a colour, and that colour is the same one the
 * account has everywhere else in a spend tool - its slice of the pie chart, its
 * dot in the ledger, its band on the budget bar. That is what makes it worth
 * putting in a picker at all. A palette applied to rows because rows look nicer
 * in colour is decoration, and it costs a reader more than it gives them.
 *
 * ## The row
 *
 * Four columns, and each one answers a different question. The tile says which
 * account. The label block says which line, twice over: the name on top, and
 * under it the code and the amount, which is the pair an approver actually
 * files against. The trailing number says how much is inside a branch, and the
 * chevron is the way in.
 *
 * The two halves of the label are separated by a hairline rather than by
 * colour, because colour is the one distinction that does NOT survive here: the
 * style sheets repaint every descendant of a highlighted row to
 * `accent-foreground`, so a muted code and a foreground amount become the same
 * grey under the pointer. A one-pixel rule is a background, and backgrounds are
 * left alone.
 *
 * `renderLabel` replaces only the label block, so the tile stays in the
 * primitive's own `icon` slot and the count and chevron stay where the
 * primitive puts them. An even earlier version built the whole row inside
 * `renderLabel`, which put the tile INSIDE the label column and left the icon
 * slot empty: nothing aligned, and the accent read as a bullet rather than a
 * marker.
 *
 * ## Marking the selection
 *
 * `indicator={false}`. By default a single-select cascader draws a check on a
 * row's inline end and every row reserves that gutter whether anything is
 * selected or not - which is what keeps a level's counts and chevrons on one
 * straight line. Here the tile already carries the selection (see
 * `TILE_SELECTED_CLASS`), so the gutter was 24px of nothing, holding the real
 * trailing content one gutter in from an edge no mark ever appeared on. The
 * prop drops the check and the gutter together, and the count and chevron now
 * end exactly where the tile begins on the other side.
 *
 * `aria-selected` is untouched by any of this: it is Base UI's and it stays on
 * every row, so a screen reader announces the selection exactly as before. Only
 * the visual mark moved.
 *
 * `selectable="any"` because a receipt may well be filed against "Travel"
 * itself rather than against a leaf. The chevron stays the way into the level,
 * so pressing the row commits and pressing the chevron drills.
 *
 * ## The trigger
 *
 * The tile follows the selection out of the panel, one size down. A 32px tile
 * is right beside two lines of type and fills a button that is 32px in most
 * styles edge to edge, so `CascaderValue` renders without the node's own icon
 * and a 24px tile is composed beside it instead. Same component, same accent,
 * same lookup - `accountOf` reads the account back out of the value - and no
 * second palette to keep in step.
 *
 * The clear control sits inside the trigger's frame, where the chevron sits,
 * but it is a SIBLING of the trigger and not a child of it. `CascaderTrigger`
 * renders a real `<button>`, so a button nested in it would be invalid HTML,
 * would fail the `nested-interactive` axe rule, and would reopen the panel on
 * its own click on the way up. Absolute positioning over the trigger's inline
 * end gets the picture without any of that. `showIcon` takes the chevron away
 * for exactly as long as the clear button is standing in for it so the two
 * never stack, `pe-8` keeps the space the chevron used to hold so a long
 * account name truncates instead of running under the button, and `end-*` and
 * `pe-*` are logical, so the arrangement mirrors in RTL.
