/**
 * Flat value to member lookup. `CascaderValue` hands its render function the

/**
 * `renderLabel` replaces only the label block, so avatars and role badges drop
 * in while the count, chevron and selected check keep working. Use `renderItem`
 * instead when the row shares nothing with the default.
 *
 * `CascaderValue` takes a render function for the same reason one level up: the
 * trigger has to name a person, and a name without a face is the one thing an
 * assignee field cannot afford. It replaces the WHOLE display, placeholder
 * included, so the empty state is spelled out here rather than passed as a
 * `placeholder` prop that would never be reached.
 *
 * Neither surface carries an alignment class. Both rows are already flex with
 * `items-center`, and both keep the avatar box under the label's line box - 20px
 * against 20px in the trigger, 24px in the wider panel row - so the circle and
 * the name share one centre line instead of the taller of the two dragging the
 * row around it.
 *
 * The role chip sits INLINE, straight after the name, and the name is the only
 * thing in the row that truncates.
 *
 * It used to trail the row, where it read as misplaced for a reason that has
 * nothing to do with the chip: a selectable leaf reserves an inline-end gutter
 * for the check mark, so the chip stopped a full gutter short of the panel edge
 * and lined up with nothing - not the edge, not the name it qualifies. Bound to
 * the name instead, "who, and at what rung" is one phrase read in one pass, and
 * the chip is out of reach of a gutter whose width is a different number in
 * every style.
 *
 * Below the name was the other option and was not taken. It would double every
 * row's height to carry one word, and a second line in a row that already has
 * an avatar reads as a description - a job title, a team, an email - rather
 * than as a chip qualifying the name above it.
 *
 * The mechanics are one class: the name is `min-w-0 truncate` and NOT `flex-1`.
 * A growing name would push the chip back to the trailing edge and take the
 * problem with it; a name sized to its own content leaves the slack AFTER the
 * chip, which is where the check gutter already is. Nothing else moved - the
 * check still marks the selected member on its own column, and the trigger
 * still names them with a face.
 *
 * The chip is a SEMANTIC outline variant, one per seniority band. Plain
 * `outline` is `bg-transparent` in light mode, so the row's highlight washed
 * straight through it, while `primary-outline` and its siblings are
 * `bg-background` - a real fill against the highlight - and spend their colour
 * on the rung rather than on decoration. See `ROLE_BADGE` for the mapping and
 * for why every one of them pins its text colour back.
