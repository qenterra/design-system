/**
 * The trigger, showing the same dot the row does - so the mark that identified

 *
 * The three pieces sit on one row of three different natural heights: an 8px
 * dot, a 14px label, and a 12px group name. `items-center` can only centre the
 * BOXES it is given, so with each piece carrying its own font's line-height the
 * two texts came out on line boxes of 20px and 16px, the taller one dragged the
 * row's centre line down, and the dot floated visibly high of the label it
 * belongs to. Pinning one explicit `leading-4` on the row settles both texts on
 * a 16px box - `text-xs` already computes to 16px, so nothing has to fight it -
 * and from there `items-center` puts the dot's centre on the label's centre for
 * real. `shrink-0` on the dot keeps it a circle when a long label squeezes the
 * row, and `min-w-0` is what lets the label truncate instead of pushing.

/**
 * Colour dots through `renderLabel`.
 *
 * A status or a priority is a category with no natural ordering in its name, so
 * a colour does the work an icon cannot: "In progress" and "In review" are one
 * glance apart when they are amber and violet, and three words apart when they
 * are not.
 *
 * Two rules keep it honest. The colour never carries meaning on its own - every
 * dot sits beside its written label, so the row still reads for anyone who
 * cannot separate the hues, and the dot is `aria-hidden` rather than announced
 * as a second, colour-shaped copy of the label. And each hue is declared as a
 * LITERAL class pair, `bg-rose-500 dark:bg-rose-400`, because Tailwind only
 * emits what it can see in the source and a template string compiles to
 * nothing.
 *
 * The reset lives in the trigger, where the chevron was, and it is a SIBLING of
 * the trigger rather than a child. `CascaderTrigger` renders a real `<button>`,
 * so a button inside it would be invalid HTML, would fail the
 * `nested-interactive` axe rule, and would open the popup on its way up from
 * its own click. Positioned over the trigger's inline end it gets the same
 * picture and none of that. `showIcon` withdraws the chevron for exactly as
 * long as the reset is standing in for it so the two never stack, `pe-8` holds
 * the space the chevron used to take so the dot and its labels truncate rather
 * than run underneath, and `end-*`/`pe-*` are logical so it all mirrors in RTL.
 *
 * The same reset is then named in the footer, and the two are additive rather
 * than duplicates. The X clears in one press for someone who can already see the
 * field; the footer row is the labelled one, in front of you while the popup is
 * open and a Tab away from the search field now that the panel routes Tab past
 * the scroll area, so it is a usable surface rather than a decoration.
 * `CascaderFooter` draws the rule
 * itself, with a `border-t` that sits exactly on the boundary between the list
 * and the footer. An explicit `CascaderSeparator` in here looked equivalent and
 * was not: it stacks its own block margin on top of BOTH containers' padding,
 * which measured 12px above the rule against 6px below, where the panel's own
 * rhythm is 4px after the search field and 0 between rows. The border needs no
 * arithmetic to be symmetric, because it is the boundary rather than a child of
 * one side of it.
