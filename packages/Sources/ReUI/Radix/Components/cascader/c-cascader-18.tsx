/**
 * A headless trigger, because a cascade cannot be summarised by listing what is
 * in the value.
 *
 * Two things go wrong if you try. The count is inflated: ticking Western Europe
 * commits the region AND its six countries, so the honest number of shipping
 * destinations is the leaves alone. And the labels are the wrong ones: the six
 * countries under a fully committed region were never pressed individually, and
 * naming them back at the user hides the one press that actually happened.
 *
 * `useCascaderSelection` hands back one ancestor chain per selected node, which
 * is enough to fix both without parsing a single value string. A leaf is a chain
 * whose last node has no children. The sample keeps only the TOP of the
 * selection - a node whose parent is committed too is already spoken for by
 * that parent - so six countries collapse back into "Western Europe" and a lone
 * country still speaks for itself.
 *
 * ## What the line says, and why it is ONE size
 *
 * It used to read "6 countries" in the control's own type with the names beside
 * it in `text-xs` muted, which is the trigger equivalent of a footnote: the
 * user's actual choice was set in the smallest type on the control, under the
 * one fact they could have worked out themselves. So the sizes are gone and
 * the order is reversed. The line now names the SELECTION first, at the
 * control's own size, and closes with the leaf total.
 *
 * Both facts are needed and neither replaces the other. The names alone cannot
 * say how big the selection is once a region stands in for six countries; the
 * count alone cannot say which six. The deepest common ancestor was the other
 * candidate and it was rejected: it reads beautifully for one branch and
 * collapses to "everywhere" the moment a second continent is ticked, which is
 * exactly the selection worth describing.
 *
 * The "+N" is gone with the small type. A truncated list already says there is
 * more, and a "+4" sitting next to a "12 countries" was two numbers counting
 * different things a few pixels apart. So the names take `min-w-0 truncate` and
 * give way, and the count is `shrink-0` and survives any trigger width - the
 * middle dot travels with it so the line never ends on a dangling separator.

/**
 * A cascading tree in a POPOVER.
 *
 * Shipping zones are the case for the cascade: "everywhere in Western Europe"
 * is one press, not six, and dropping a single country has to demote the region
 * from fully selected to partial rather than leaving a checkbox that lies. The
 * comment deliberately avoids the shorter phrasing there: `verify-registry`
 * scans for `from "..."` to collect a file's imports, and a quoted word after
 * `from` inside a COMMENT is read as an undeclared dependency. Continent,
 * region, country is the shallowest tree where that is worth showing. At two
 * levels a branch is full or empty at a glance and the partial state carries
 * nothing.
 *
 * Three things make the selection work together. `cascade` propagates a commit
 * over the pressed node's subtree and reconciles its ancestors afterwards.
 * `selectable="any"` is what lets a branch be pressed at all - without it there
 * is nothing for a cascade to start from. And tree mode keeps the whole shape
 * visible, which is the only way a partial state means anything.
 *
 * The popup is the reason this exists as its own example rather than as a
 * variant of an inline one. A tree is the single mode whose height is under the
 * USER's control: every disclosure adds or removes rows while the panel is
 * already anchored to the trigger, so expanding Africa asks the popup to
 * re-measure on a press that had nothing to do with opening it. Get the bound
 * wrong and the last rows land off the bottom of the screen, or the popup flips
 * to the other side of the trigger mid-interaction.
 *
 * Which is the whole height contract: `CascaderList` takes NO `maxHeight` here.
 * Inline there is no positioner, nothing publishes `--available-height`, and an
 * explicit cap is the only bound in existence - which is why this example
 * carried `maxHeight={260}` while it was inline. Under `CascaderContent` the
 * positioner publishes the distance from the trigger to the edge of the
 * viewport, the list bounds itself at `min(--available-height, 24rem)`, and the
 * scroll area inside absorbs everything past that. The popup stops at the
 * viewport, and expanding a branch scrolls the rows rather than growing it.
 *
 * It opens with nothing picked and Western Europe already expanded, so the
 * first country ticked is also the first indeterminate region. The number on a
 * branch is the primitive's own: children until something inside is selected,
 * then the selected total in the accent colour, which is the second reading of
 * "some" for anyone who cannot see the box's third state.
 *
 * The heading over the control is gone. It said "Countries this store ships
 * to" above a trigger whose empty state already says "Select shipping
 * destinations" and whose filled state names what was picked, so it was the
 * same sentence twice with the field between them. A real form has a `Field`
 * and a `Label` doing accessible-name work; a one-control example has neither,
 * and a bare `<p>` is decoration that only pretends to.

          {/* WIDER THAN THE TRIGGER, on purpose, and the one measurement that
              fixes the deepest level.

              Where a country row's width goes, in nova, with the popup at the
              trigger's own 384px: 8px of list padding, then a 6px start inset
              plus 32px of indent (two levels at the row's default 16), a 6px
              end inset, an 18px expander slot the leaf reserves but cannot
              use, a 16px checkbox, a 20px flag and three 8px gaps. 130px of
              the 384 is gone before the country name starts, and in a narrow
              embed - a catalog card, a phone - the popup falls back to its own
              floor and the name is down to about 190px.

              `w-80` was that floor, and at this demo's width it was INERT:
              320px never beats the `min-w-(--anchor-width)` the popup already
              takes from a 384px trigger, so the class changed no pixel anyone
              ever saw. `CascaderContent` deliberately does not clamp to the
              anchor - a cascade is routinely wider than the control that opens
              it - so the fix is to name a width ABOVE the anchor. 416px puts
              every one of those 32px into the label column at every depth and
              raises the narrow-embed floor by the same amount. It stays
              bounded: `max-w-(--available-width)` still clamps it on a small
              viewport.

              Three alternatives were rejected. A smaller per-depth `indent` is
              the tempting one, but `CascaderItem` only takes it from a row you
              render yourself, and `CascaderItems`' tree-mode render prop hands
              back a node and an index - no `expanded`, no `aria-setsize` or
              `aria-posinset`. `depth` still resolves itself off the tree
              index, `expanded` has no such fallback, so every branch would
              draw a collapsed chevron and the tree would lose its position
              metadata. That is accessibility traded for 8px a level. Trimming
              the row has nothing left to take: the flag IS the icon slot, the
              name IS the label, and the empty expander slot and the leading
              checkbox are per-list decisions that keep one label column per
              depth. And widening the CONTROL to `max-w-md` buys the same
              pixels by changing what the example is about - a normal-width
              field with a big tree behind it. */}
