/**
 * One tile per library, reused by every row in the first column.
 *
 * The hue is an IDENTIFIER, not a status: it tells "Engineering" from "Design
 * system" at a glance and says nothing about either. So the tile itself stays
 * neutral - `outline` is a plain bordered surface with no tint of its own - and
 * only the glyph carries the colour. Sixteen filled swatches down a column would
 * read as sixteen alerts.
 *
 * Three things about those colour classes, in order of how often they bite:
 *
 * 1. **They are literals.** Tailwind scans source TEXT, so a computed
 *    `text-${hue}-600` compiles to nothing and the column ships uncoloured.
 * 2. **Each is a light/dark PAIR.** A 600 that is comfortable on a white card
 *    goes muddy on a near-black popup, so the dark half steps up to a 400.
 * 3. **Each is `!`, at BOTH levels.** The shared combobox sheet paints the
 *    highlighted row with `data-highlighted:**:text-accent-foreground`, a
 *    DESCENDANT selector that reaches the `<path>` inside the svg. Since the
 *    path draws with `currentColor`, pinning the svg alone changes nothing -
 *    `text-*!` and `**:text-*!` have to be set together or the accent drains
 *    out of whichever row the pointer is on, which is the one row being looked
 *    at.
 *
 * With sixteen libraries the hues also have to survive being READ IN ORDER, so
 * neighbours in the list are neighbours nowhere on the wheel: no two adjacent
 * rows sit in the same family, which is what stops "teal, emerald, lime" from
 * arriving as one long green smear when the column scrolls past.
 *
 * The glyph carries no `size-*`. `IconTile` sizes its children through
 * `--icon-tile-icon-size`, and any `size-` class on the svg opts that child out
 * of the tile's scale.

/**
 * The runtime chip. One component, both surfaces, one variant for every row.
 *
 * `info-outline` rather than plain `outline`: the plain one is `bg-transparent`
 * in light mode, so the row highlight washes straight through the chip and the
 * runtime lands on a tinted band instead of on its own surface. The semantic
 * outline variants are `bg-background`, an opaque plate the highlight cannot
 * reach, and they spend their colour on the text rather than on a fill.
 *
 * ONE variant across every row is the point. A ladder of colours by length
 * would invent a status where there is only a duration, and the two facts a row
 * already carries - what kind of thing it is, how long it takes - are spoken by
 * the leading glyph and by the number itself.
 *
 * `text-info-foreground!` re-states the variant's own colour so the highlighted
 * row cannot repaint it. Only ONE level of pin is needed here, unlike the
 * library tiles above: the chip holds text, not an svg, so there is no `<path>`
 * further down drawing itself in `currentColor`.
 *
 * Default `size`, not `sm`. At the default the chip is `h-5` with `text-xs`,
 * which is exactly the line box of a `text-sm` row, so the runtime reads at the
 * same weight as the title beside it without making a single row taller.

 * runtime keeps the same chip it wore in the row: the thing that identified an
 * item in the list is the thing that identifies it once chosen, down to the
 * variant, which is why both surfaces render `LengthBadge` rather than two
 * badges that would drift apart the first time one of them is tweaked.
 *
 * With no label above the control, the empty state is the only thing naming the
 * field, so it says what a pick DOES ("Select an item to feature") instead of
 * echoing a heading that is no longer there.
 *
 * `min-w-0` on both texts and `truncate` on each is what lets the title give
 * way before the collection name does. The chip is `shrink-0` so a long title
 * never squeezes a runtime into an ellipsis.

/**
 * Columns mode - Miller columns, the whole open trail side by side.
 *
 * A media library is the shape this layout was built for: the library, the
 * collection and the item stay on screen together, so you compare two seasons
 * without losing the library you came from, and stepping back is a glance
 * rather than a Back button. Arrow Left and Right move between columns, Up and
 * Down within one.
 *
 * Every column here is longer than the panel is tall, and that is the whole
 * demonstration. Sixteen libraries overflow the first column, the podcast
 * archive carries ten seasons and side collections in the second, and Season 4
 * runs to forty-four episodes in the third. Scroll any one of them and the
 * other two do not move: each pane owns its own thumb, so losing your place in
 * a long list of episodes never costs you the library you came from. A demo
 * where every column fits would show the layout and hide the reason for it.
 *
 * Each column earns its width. The first is identity: a neutral `IconTile` with
 * a coloured glyph, one hue per library. The second is structure: one repeated
 * stack mark, because a column of one kind of thing does not need sixteen
 * different marks to say so. The third is the payload: a type glyph on the
 * lead, the title, and the runtime as a trailing chip, all on ONE line.
 *
 * Branch rows do NOT get a chip. `CascaderItem` already draws a child count
 * next to the chevron, so a chip there would put two numbers on one row with
 * nothing to tell them apart. The count answers "how much is in here" and the
 * chip answers "how long is this", and only leaves have the second question.
 *
 * `columnWidth` runs a little over the primitive's 220px default rather than
 * well under it. The leaf row spends real width on a leading glyph and on a
 * trailing chip that now sits at the badge's default size - `text-xs`, not the
 * `sm` variant's 10px - and a runtime like "1:12:08" is seven glyphs wide at
 * that size. At the 180 this example used to pass, a title had about a hundred
 * pixels left and truncated after two words.
 *
 * `maxHeight` is a cap, not a height, and it moved up with the chip. At the
 * badge's default size the chip is `h-5`, which is exactly the line box of a
 * `text-sm` row - Nova and its siblings do not grow by a pixel - but it stands
 * a few pixels above the `text-xs` line box of the tighter styles, so their
 * rows do grow. Holding the old 260 would have quietly cost those styles a
 * visible row, so the cap moves with the row rather than the other way round.
 *
 * `w-auto min-w-0` on the content is load-bearing. `CascaderContent` carries
 * `min-w-(--anchor-width)` so a single-column popup lines up under its trigger,
 * and in columns mode that floor stops the popup shrinking to the width its
 * columns actually need. Clearing it lets the panel size to its content in both
 * directions.
 *
 * The wrapper pins itself to the TOP of the preview surface (`self-start`).
 * Both the docs frame and the catalog card centre their child vertically, and
 * a wide columns popup changes the measured height as panes open, so a centred
 * demo jumps while you navigate. `pt-6` keeps the top edge deliberate rather
 * than flush. `items-center` stays: in a column that is horizontal centring.
