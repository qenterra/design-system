/**
 * Multi-select. Rows render checkboxes, the popup stays open while you pick,
 * and `max` caps the selection. Deleting projects is disabled to show that a
 * blocked permission stays visible and announced rather than hidden.
 *
 * The clear control stands exactly where the chevron stood, and it is a SIBLING
 * of the trigger rather than something inside it. `CascaderTrigger` renders a
 * real `<button>`, so a button nested in it would be invalid HTML, would fail
 * the `nested-interactive` axe rule, and would open the popup on the way up
 * from its own click. Absolutely positioning it over the trigger's inline end
 * buys the same picture and none of that: the press lands on the clear button
 * and stops there.
 *
 * Two details make the swap read as one control rather than two. `showIcon`
 * takes the chevron away for exactly as long as the clear button is standing in
 * for it, so the two never stack. And `pe-8` reserves the room the chevron used
 * to occupy, so a five-permission summary truncates before it reaches the
 * button instead of sliding underneath it. Both insets are logical (`end-*`,
 * `pe-*`), so the whole arrangement mirrors in RTL.
 *
 * The clear is then offered a SECOND time in the footer, and the two are
 * additive rather than duplicates. The X is the one press out for someone who
 * can already see the summary; the footer row is the named one, in front of you
 * while the popup is open and a Tab away from the search field now that the
 * panel routes Tab past the scroll area, so it is a usable surface rather than a
 * decoration. `CascaderFooter` draws the rule
 * itself, with a `border-t` that sits exactly on the boundary between the list
 * and the footer. An explicit `CascaderSeparator` in here looked equivalent and
 * was not: it stacks its own block margin on top of BOTH containers' padding,
 * which measured 12px above the rule against 6px below, where the panel's own
 * rhythm is 4px after the search field and 0 between rows. The border needs no
 * arithmetic to be symmetric, because it is the boundary rather than a child of
 * one side of it.
