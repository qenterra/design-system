/**
 * Windowed levels.
 *
 * `CascaderVirtualItems` is a drop-in replacement for `CascaderItems`: below
 * `virtualizeThreshold` rows it renders exactly what `CascaderItems` renders,
 * and above it, it windows. The region level here is six rows and stays plain
 * DOM; drilling into one switches the same list to windowing without touching
 * the keyboard model, the search or the row component.
 *
 * ## The row
 *
 * A windowed row is the one row a demo cannot fake, so it is worth making it a
 * real one: a flag, a country, the market inside it and a reach figure, all on
 * a single line. The composition is the data grid's - a leading glyph, a label
 * that gives way, a trailing metric - translated to a list row, where
 * "trailing" has to be earned by `flex-1` on the label rather than granted by a
 * column. Only the country and the market give way; the badge holds its width,
 * because a cut number is worse than a shortened name.
 *
 * The COUNTRY is the label and the market territory is the muted second slot,
 * which is the way round a reader scans it: the country is what tells you where
 * you are, and the territory only separates the several dozen rows that share
 * it. The region is named once, by the breadcrumb above the list, and never
 * repeated down the rows - a level whose every row re-states the level it is in
 * wastes the widest part of the row on the one word already on screen.
 *
 * The flag goes on `node.icon` rather than into `renderLabel`. The primitive's
 * icon slot is already the leading, `shrink-0` position the pattern wants, and
 * putting it there means the closed trigger shows the flag beside the chosen
 * market for free.
 *
 * The badge is toned by reach rather than left neutral, on the rule tabled at
 * `REACH_TIERS`. A metric that is always the same grey is a metric the reader
 * has to actually read before it means anything; four tones let a scroll answer
 * "where are the big markets" without stopping on a single row.
 *
 * Rows are one line tall, so the estimate is 36 - but only until they mount.
 * Every row is measured after it renders, which is what keeps the scroll
 * position and the highlight in agreement across the eight styles, each of
 * which sets its own row height.
 *
 * ## Why the regions are the sizes they are
 *
 * The earlier version of this example booted with a deep initial value and a
 * 2,500-row level, and it opened badly: a blank frame, a long freeze, then
 * rows. Neither half of that was the windowing.
 *
 * `revealSelected` (on by default) navigates to the level holding the current
 * selection IN THE SAME COMMIT that opens the popup, so with a deep initial
 * value the popup's very first mount lands on the big level rather than on the
 * six-row root. Measured in jsdom, at 2,500 rows per level:
 *
 * | what                                  | cost   |
 * | ------------------------------------- | ------ |
 * | open, deep preselection, reveal on     | 865 ms |
 * | open, deep preselection, reveal off    | 16 ms  |
 * | open at the root, then drill into it   | 13 ms  |
 * | type into the 2,500-row level          | 9 ms   |
 *
 * So the level itself is cheap to render, to filter and to window - it is
 * mounting the popup ONTO it that is not, and the cost is Base UI's per-item
 * work at mount rather than the DOM (plain rows measured 453 ms against the
 * window's 668 ms on the same data). The blank frame is the level-swap reset
 * that has to render one empty list to clamp the highlighted index, which is
 * exactly the "flickering" part.
 *
 * Two consequences, both applied here. Starting unselected means the first open
 * is the six-row root. And because `CascaderContent` unmounts on close, every
 * REOPEN after a deep pick pays that mount again - 483 ms at 2,500 rows against
 * 85 ms at 500 - so the constraint is on the LARGEST level, not on the total.
 * Asia Pacific's 674 is the largest here, which sits with the 500 that measured
 * 85 ms rather than anywhere near the 2,500 that measured 483.
 *
 * Under that ceiling the counts differ per region, because a real catalogue's
 * do. The previous revision gave all six the same round 500, and the one number
 * a reader could actually check - the child count the primitive prints on each
 * region row - came out identical six times down the root level, which reads as
 * a placeholder rather than as a directory. Each region now carries its own
 * figure, 317 through 674, still every one of them multiples past
 * `virtualizeThreshold` and 2,948 rows overall: far past the point where plain
 * DOM rows stop being viable, and windowing is visibly working on the smallest
 * level as well as on the biggest.
