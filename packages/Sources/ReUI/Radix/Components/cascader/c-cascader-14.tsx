/**
 * The root level, in two named runs.
 *
 * `CascaderItems` renders ONE flat run per level, so a level with headings has
 * to be composed by hand - and the rules it has to keep are all about the array
 * it is composed from. `Combobox.Root` is given `renderedItems`, and Base UI
 * sizes its `listRef` from that array and maps a highlight index straight back
 * into it. So the rows in the DOM must be exactly that array, in that order,
 * each node once: split it with `slice`, never rebuild it with `filter` or by
 * pulling a node in from somewhere else in the tree. A recent run is therefore
 * a REORDERING of the root level (see `items` below), not a second copy of
 * three rows that already appear further down.
 *
 * Two more rules that a hand-written run is on the hook for:
 *
 * - `aria-setsize` and `aria-posinset` count across the whole LEVEL, not the
 *   group. Numbering each run from one would have the second group announce
 *   "1 of 7" under a heading that is genuinely the fourth row of ten.
 * - No `index` prop. `CascaderItem` only forwards one while the list is
 *   windowed; passing it here would make each row self-register, truncate Base
 *   UI's `listRef` and leave `aria-activedescendant` pointing at nothing.
 *
 * The groups are a ROOT-level affordance and nothing else. Inside a space there
 * is no "recently used" run to show, and while a query is running the level is
 * a set of search hits whose order is the match order - a heading over either
 * would name a group that does not exist. Both cases fall back to the plain
 * flat run, which is also where deep-search results pick up their ancestor path.

/**
 * A grouped level: a short run of recent destinations above the full catalogue.
 *
 * Moving a page is a two-part question - which space, then which folder - and
 * drill-down answers it one part at a time, which is the right shape right up
 * until you notice that most moves go back to somewhere you were last week. A
 * flat list of ten spaces makes those three cost the same as the other seven.
 * Lifting them into their own named run is what earns the grouping: it turns
 * the common move into one press and a pick, and it costs the catalogue
 * nothing, because the recent run is the same ten root entries in a different
 * order rather than three extra rows.
 *
 * Recency is real here, not a decoration. Pick a folder and its space moves to
 * the head of the run, which is the whole reason `items` is derived from state
 * instead of being the static array below it. Order is the ONLY thing that
 * changes: the tree is the same tree, and a space appears exactly once in it.
 *
 * `revealSelected={false}` for the same reason. Reopening onto the level that
 * holds the current selection is right for a field being edited, but a move is
 * a fresh action every time - it should start at the root, where the recent run
 * is, not inside whichever space was used last.
