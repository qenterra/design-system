/**
 * Both axes belong to the consumer's ScrollArea here: `CodeBlockContent`
 * hands the surface over without an internal scroll container, and the block
 * itself stays the bordered chrome. `max-h` rather than a fixed height, so a
 * short file does not leave dead space under the code.
 *
 * With no header the copy button pins itself over the code surface, hidden
 * until the block is hovered or the button takes focus. Line 1 scrolls
 * underneath it, so the button needs a backdrop of its own: `outline` draws
 * the border, and `bg-card` fills it (the variant's own dark fill is 4.5%
 * opaque, which the code shows through).
