 *
 * The colour arrives with its own `!`, and the paths are pinned to inherit it,
 * because every style sheet repaints a highlighted row's descendants with
 * `color: var(--accent-foreground)` at a specificity no plain utility beats.
 * Unpinned, the star greys out under the cursor, and each path's `currentColor`

            Four overrides, and every one of them undoes the same bug.
            `DataGridPagination` goes single row at `sm`, which is a VIEWPORT
            query rather than a container one, so inside a card narrower than
            640px it stacks its three parts however wide the card itself is:
            page buttons, then the record range, then rows-per-page, reversed by
            `order-*` and about 140px tall. In a preview frame that is most of
            the height this example has to spend, and a pager nobody can see
            cannot show that the query changed the page count.
              flex-row py-0      the parent's own axis and padding. Plain
                                 utilities, because the primitive merges this
                                 className through `cn`, so tailwind-merge drops
                                 the `flex-col` and `py-2.5` it replaces.
              **:order-none!     source order at every depth. Two levels need
                                 it, the two halves of the bar and the range
                                 against the buttons inside the right half.
              *:py-0!            the two halves' own stacking padding.
              *:last:flex-row!   the right half, which stacks internally too.
            The three `!` are load-bearing: those classes live on the
            primitive's own children, out of tailwind-merge's reach, so nothing
            else can win against them.

            `flex-wrap` is left alone deliberately, so this degrades rather than
            breaks: on a genuinely narrow phone the two halves wrap to two rows
            instead of forcing a 400px row into 375px.
