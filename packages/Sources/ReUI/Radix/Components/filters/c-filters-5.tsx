/**
 * The grid IS the panel's width, and its height is the whole budget.
 *
 * The chip's value popover is `w-auto`, so whatever this editor measures, the
 * popover measures. An earlier version put a fixed `w-72` on the panel and left
 * the calendar at its natural size inside it, and a calendar is seven columns
 * of `--cell-size`: 224px in most styles, 196 in nova and lyra, 168 in mira,
 * never 288. So every style drew a strip of empty popover down one side of the
 * grid. The cell is PINNED here instead, so seven of them is a width this file
 * knows, and the calendar's own padding goes to zero because the panel already
 * carries some.
 *
 * The row gap is the height half, and it was the one that overflowed. The
 * shadcn calendar gives every week `mt-2`, so a 28px cell runs on a 36px pitch:
 * flush across, airy down, and six of those gaps are 48px of a popover that has
 * roughly 380 to spend before it flips up over the bar it is anchored to. The
 * two arbitrary variants below out-specify the defaults they replace (both are
 * a descendant selector against a bare utility class), so the grid tightens
 * without the primitive being touched. `tbody tr` rather than `.rdp-week`
 * because the table is the calendar's own markup, not a class name it happens
 * to carry.
 *
 * One constant, both panels: a single date and a range are the same grid at the
 * same density, and the range simply draws two of them.
