 * the rows underneath it eventually, and the drift would read as a fault in the
 * query rather than as a fault here.
 *
 * THE PATH IS PASSED IN rather than taken from the context, because there is no
 * path in the context to take: `FilterValueDisplayContext` carries the field,
 * and a field knows its own `id` and nothing about where it hangs. That is not
 * a gap to work around - a display callback is declared ON the field, so where

  /**
   * The aggregate strip, and the reason this example took its grid from the
   * totals-footer demo rather than from the sortable-columns one the chip-row
   * sibling copied.
   *
   * A builder is the chrome you reach for when the question is complicated, and
   * a complicated question deserves an answer with a number in it. Sorting is
   * the same in both chromes and proves nothing about the query; a total that
   * moves the moment a group's combinator flips is the shortest honest proof
   * that the tree reached the data.
   *
   * The label spans the three text columns, so each number sits under the
   * column it sums, and the two totals carry the same right alignment their
   * columns do - a total that did not would be the one number on screen not
   * lining up with the figures it adds.
   *
   * A foot cell is not a body cell, so `cellClassName` does not reach it and
   * the two gutter columns have to be given theirs by hand. The spanning label
   * is the leading cell here even though it covers three columns, which is why
   * it takes the start gutter rather than the account column's own foot cell -
   * there isn't one.

            `DataGridPagination` goes single row at `sm`, which is a VIEWPORT
            query rather than a container one, so inside a card narrower than
            640px it stacks its three parts however wide the card itself is:
            page buttons, then the record range, then rows-per-page, reversed by
            `order-*` and about 140px tall. In a preview frame that is most of
            the height this example has to spend, and a pager nobody can see
            cannot show that the query changed the page count.
              flex-row py-0      the parent's own axis and padding. Plain
                                 utilities, because the primitive merges this
                                 className through `cn`, so tailwind-merge drops
                                 the `flex-col` and `py-2.5` it replaces.

            The three `!` are load-bearing: those classes live on the
            primitive's own children, out of tailwind-merge's reach, so nothing
            else can win against them.

            `flex-wrap` is left alone deliberately, so this degrades rather than
            breaks: on a genuinely narrow phone the two halves wrap to two rows
