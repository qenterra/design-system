        FOUR chips, and the fourth is the last one that fits.

        Five editors are on show, and seeding one chip each is the obvious
        thing: every editor would then be one press away. It does not fit, and
        the way it fails is worse than the click it saves. The bar is a wrapping
        row whose chips live in an inner toolbar, and a flex child that wraps
        internally claims the full width of its line, so the moment the fifth
        chip goes to a second row the toolbar owns BOTH rows and pushes Add
        filter and Clear onto a third - the trigger at the far left, Clear at
        the far right, a thousand pixels of nothing between them.

        Measured at the width a catalog card gives this bar (1128px), the five
        chips run 1172 to 1336 depending on the style against a budget of 977 to
        1036. No arrangement of five fits and no wording closes a 300px gap, so
        the count is the thing that gives. Two of the five drops leave a row that
        fits; this one clears sera by 64px where dropping Channel clears it by
        15, and it costs the least besides, because Permissions drew the same
        `PickedLabels` display the Channel chip already shows - and shows better,
        since Channel carries the overflow count too. Its editor is reachable
        from Add filter like any other field.
