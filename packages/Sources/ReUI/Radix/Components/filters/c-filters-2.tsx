 * question stops being "which noun is this" and becomes "will this ask me for a
 * number, a word or a choice", and that is the only thing telling one generated
 * row from the next.
 *
 * Icon names are written out per set rather than built by a helper: the shadcn
 * CLI rewrites these attributes to a real import at install time and only

// a second meaning for the same click.

// it holds, which is the truth for a level declared in full; an explicit count
// is for the level that knows its total before it has fetched it, which is the

 * Both generated branches state their `count` rather than leaving the row to
 * count the children it was handed, which is what the prop is for: a level
 * whose total is known before it is read. And the primitive indexes the schema
 * on a content SIGNATURE rather than on the array's identity, so this tree is
