/**
 * Async drill-down: load BEFORE you move.
 *
 * Nothing is known up front. The root level, each release and each page of
 * assets is fetched as it comes into view, and `getChildren` is asked for one
 * level at a time.
 *
 * The part worth watching is what a press does while the fetch is in flight.
 * The panel does NOT navigate and then show a loading screen. It stays on the
 * level you are reading and turns THAT row's chevron into a spinner in the same
 * 16px box, so nothing reflows, the rows around it stay readable, and a failed
 * request leaves you where you were with a retry on the row you pressed rather
 * than on an error screen for a level you never saw. The sub-level renders only
 * once its children exist.
 *
 * `getChildren` hands back a cursor when there is more, which turns the last
 * row of a level into a "Load more" affordance - a real, keyboard reachable
 * option rather than an invisible scroll sentinel.
 *
 * Loaded pages are cached until `loadKey` changes, so walking back up the tree
 * and down again costs nothing.
 *
 * Every row is one line: icon, label, trailing badge. `renderLabel` replaces
 * only the label block, so the count, the chevron and the spinner that takes
 * its place all keep working while the badge rides along beside them. A second
 * line under the label would push the loading affordance further from the text
 * it belongs to and halve the number of rows a level can show.
 *
 * That badge is a semantic outline variant, picked per row from `TONE_BADGE`.
 * The row it sits on turns `bg-accent` under the pointer, so the chip needs a
 * fill of its own and a pinned text colour to survive the highlight.
