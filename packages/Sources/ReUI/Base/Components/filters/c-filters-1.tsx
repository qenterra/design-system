 * and remixicon draw theirs as an already filled RING, which no class can
 * solidify. Filling would therefore give three libraries a solid star and two a
 * hollow one, so all five stay hollow.
 *
 * The colour arrives with its own `!`, and the paths are pinned to inherit it,
 * because every style sheet repaints a highlighted row's descendants with
 * `color: var(--accent-foreground)` at a specificity no plain utility beats.
 * Unpinned, the star greys out under the cursor, and each path's `currentColor`

        rows and stops there at 136px, which puts this box at y=160 inside the
